	I come from China and grew up in Beijing, which is a city with a long history. I used to study in Minzu University in China for 2 years and majored in Japanese language and culture, but I transferred to The University of Iowa in 2012. Now I am a senior accounting and BAIS major in University of Iowa, and I hope I can be an IT auditor after graduation from university

	<p>In my spare time, I usually listen to music and watch movie to relax. I love country music and hip-pop, and my favorite movie could be Transformer. In vacation, I usually go travelling around, and I have been to a lot of countries such as Korea, Singapore, Italy and France. Last summer I went to Italy for a summer program for one month. Italy is a beautiful country, and it is a country with culture and art, and I love the culture, the scene and the food in Italy. For my next trip, I plan to go to Japan.
